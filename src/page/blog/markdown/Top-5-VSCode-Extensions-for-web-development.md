# Top 5 VS Code extensions for Web Development

It is the year 2022 and Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the best IDE for Web Developers. Microsoft has been doing a fantastic job of adding new features to it's IDE, but that's not enough, so we developers tend to get help from 3rd party extensions to fasten the development. And here are my top 5 extensions for web development using HTML & CSS.

1. **[Highlight Matching Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag)**
2. **[HTML CSS Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css)**
3. **[CSS Peek](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek)**
4. **[Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)**
5. **[Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)**


## Highlight Matching Tag

Any Markup language looks good when it is just few lines of code snippet but it is not the case in any real world project where you will have hundreds of different tags and few of them are simple div tags containing CSS classes to form a beautiiful web page.

In such cases, often it becomes hard to understand where a tag starts and ends and a tool like **[Highlight Matching Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag)** solves the problem by highlighting the start and ends of each tag.
