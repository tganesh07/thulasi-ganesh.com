# Top 5 VS Code extensions for Web Development

It is the year 2022 and Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the best IDE for Web Developers. Microsoft has been doing a fantastic job of adding new features to it's IDE, but that's not enough, so we developers tend to get help from 3rd party extensions to fasten the development. And here are my top 5 extensions for web development using HTML & CSS.

1. **[Highlight Matching Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag)**
2. **[HTML CSS Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css)**

## [Highlight Matching Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag)

Any Markup language looks good when it is just few lines of code snippet but it is not the case in any real world project where you will have hundreds of different tags and few of them are simple div tags containing CSS classes to form a beautiiful web page.

In such cases, often it becomes hard to understand where a tag starts and ends and a tools like **[Highlight Matching Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag)** solves the problem by highlighting the start and ends of each tags.

## [HTML CSS Support]((https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ecmel.vscode-html-css))

One of the most important feature of an IDE is to display relevant information as you start to type-in, so you as a developer can get things done faster. As you start to type in the first few characters of the CSS class or Id in your HTML file, this extenstion lets you view all the CSS classes that starts with the typed characters from all the CSS, LESS and SASS files in your project.

## [CSS Peek](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pranaygp.vscode-css-peek)
As the name suggests, it lets you take a peek into the CSS class contents from the HTML file itself. All you have to do is just press cntrl and hover over the CSS class name and ta-da you'll see a small pop-up with the full content of that class.

Not only take a peek but also takes you for a fun trip to the CSS file when you cntrl click the class and then you can add/modify/delete properties that you want and don't forget to hit the save button, if you want to see the changes.

## [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
Formatting your source code is an important step in code readability and Prettier  does a great job. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

## [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
Now that we are done with coding and how to test it? 

The old fashioned way of you manually opening the HTML file in a browser is not necessary anymore and thanks to Live Server extension, which quickly launches a local development server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages in just a click of a button.
